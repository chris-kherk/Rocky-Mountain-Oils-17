                    The solar plexus chakra, also known as the third chakra or Manipura chakra, is responsible for self-esteem, boundaries, and willpower. Working with the solar plexus chakra helps us unlock deeper levels of authenticity in our lives and develop the confidence to stand in our truth. It also supports courage and gut intuition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    New to the concept of chakras? <a href="https://www.rockymountainoils.com/pages/chakra-blends">Chakras</a> are energy centers which are believed to control the flow of prana (also known as chi or life-force energy) within the body. The term “chakra” is a Sanskrit word that means “wheel” or “disk.” It dates back to ancient Indian texts called the Vedas and Tantras, which first mentioned chakras as early as 1500 BC. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyone can benefit from working with chakras, regardless of their own spiritual beliefs. In fact, individuals who aren’t spiritual can still find the chakra system useful as a metaphor for bringing greater balance and stability into their lives. Meditating on different chakras, such as the solar plexus chakra, can be a useful tool for setting intentions, practicing affirmations, or developing mantras. Some people also find chakras useful for other holistic healing modalities such as acupuncture.

                    There are many chakras, however, most energy work focuses on the main Seven Chakras which are said to be located up and down the spine. The solar plexus chakra, as its name implies, is positioned at the solar plexus. It is the third chakra and is associated with the color yellow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chakras can be visualized as interconnected gates, or dams, which guide the flow of our body’s energy. When each chakra is functioning in harmony with the rest of the system, the energy flows freely and we feel optimized. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    But if one chakra is misaligned – either blocked off, or too open – it disrupts this delicate harmony. This causes our energy to become stagnant or excessive, which can lead to various problems in our lives. “Balancing the chakras” means bringing each chakra back into alignment with the entire system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every chakra is said to govern different feelings, personality traits, and even physical attributes. Wondering what is the solar plexus chakra responsible for? In this blog, we’ll dive deeper into solar plexus chakra meaning and offer some simple yet powerful methods of solar plexus chakra healing.

                <h3>Manipura: The Solar Plexus Chakra or Third Chakra</h3>
                <p>
                    The solar plexus chakra is located along the spine at the solar plexus, in the upper abdomen approximately two inches above the navel. It’s the third of the seven chakras and is also referred to by its Sanskrit name, <i>Manipura</i>, which translates to “shining gem.” Occasionally, it is referred to as the yellow chakra.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personal power is the core of the solar plexus chakra. It represents authenticity, confidence, self-responsibility, and self-discipline. When properly aligned, the solar plexus chakra allows us to listen to our intuition more clearly, set healthy boundaries, and stand in our power. It lets our most authentic self shine brightly. The solar plexus chakra also embodies unlimited potential to transform thought or inertia into action.
